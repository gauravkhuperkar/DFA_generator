# DFA_generator

A DFA generator will accept a 5 tuple that consists of a set of states,
an alphabet set, a transition function, an initial state and a set of final states.
It will return a DFA which in turn can determine whether a string is in that language or not.
5 tuple can also be specified as a JSON object in a file.
